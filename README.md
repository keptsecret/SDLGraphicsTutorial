# Simple Skeleton Engine

Learning more about OpenGL and SDL, and making a game engine in the process (looks like it'll be 2D for now)

__Dependencies__:

* SDL
* Glew (on Windows, MacOS and Linux can directly use OpenGL headers but not supported by this project)
* GLM
* SDL_TTF
* SDL_mixer

_Note: now included in project by default!_  
_Sub-note: need to include DLLs at some point_
